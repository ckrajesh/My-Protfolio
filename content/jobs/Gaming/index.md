- Why I love gaming is because they are an escape from our sometimes boring and monotonous life...
- The biggest checks in the world over the next decade are gonna be e-sports stars rather than athletes!!!

- Books
- I don't want to say it as my intrest cause it's my habit.
- some of the books which I liked and also I suggest you are 
    - Do Epic shit
    - A Nation of Idiots
    - Everything is fucked
